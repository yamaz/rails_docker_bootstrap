bootstrap with ruby/rails on docker without ruby and rails installation.

Motivation: I don't want to install ruby/Rails environment on the host.

# requiremts
- docker
- bash(4+)

# Usage

## setup
```
./bin/setup <appname(should be lowercase)>
```

## container up
```
./bin/up
```

## container down
```
./bin/down
```
